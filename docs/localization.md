# Localization

## Introduction

### Idea Numero Uno

The application runs as `default` regardless. But rely too on an applications configuration `streams.applications` perhaps. That could be used to establish other applications (like locales) and you could kinda.. add detail from there. So by default it'd be empty - always default everything. But when you start defining applications they separate.

Choose streams data
Access data from default application data?
