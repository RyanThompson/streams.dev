Streams starts by defining a data source and structure. Each of these descriptions are declared with a simple JSON file.

## How do we leverage Streams?

We call each of these JSON declared data-models a [stream](streams). Each stream declares it's structure using [fields](fields).

Once a stream has been declared you can:

- [Start managing it](entries)
- [Start sharing it](api)
