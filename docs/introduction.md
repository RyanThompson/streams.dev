Using streams-configured data structures instantly provides extensive and universally helpful functionality for Laravel applications.

We highly suggest you review the [who is it for](who-is-it-for) and [how it works](how-it-works) pages and [use cases](/use-cases) to learn more before [getting started](installation).

### Not a CMS

Streams is not a CMS. It can easily be used without UI like Jekyll for example. It can even be used _with_ a Laravel CMS and, might make it better. Streams does not assume data is content nor that your application is a website. That said, it works great for that and many other [use cases](#use-cases/cms).
