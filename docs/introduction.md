## What is streams?

### Streams Core
[Streams Core](core/introduction) builds upon streams configured data-structures to standardize your application's data modeling, querying and storage. Fetch, store and interact with data consistently regardless of the source of the data. Streams are configured as flat-file by default but support Eloquent models, generic Laravel databases, and any other source you can wrap with our basic interface like APIs.

### Streams UI

[Streams UI](ui/introduction) is a natural extension of [Streams Core](core/introduction) and provides instant bolt-on access to a control panel, forms, tables and more, all using your Streams cnofigured data-structures for default functionality. Extreme extensibility let you fine-tune your application UI however needed quickly and easily.

### Streams API

[Streams API](#ui/api) is a natural extension of [Streams Core](core/introduction) and provides instant bolt-on access to a standardized RESTful API. Extreme extensibility let you fine-tune your application API however needed quickly and easily.
