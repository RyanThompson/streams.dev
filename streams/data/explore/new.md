Laravel Streams is a **system of interconnected packages** designed to carry as **little technical debt** as possible. For this reason, we organize our core features into composer packages.

<!-- Whether you end up using this software or not, we believe you can save time and headache by aligning with our way of organizing and defining your project's parameters.  -->
