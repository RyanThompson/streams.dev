Our primary mission is to **abstract and standardize data**. , interacting with, and presentation of information and to make it accessible to the widest range of developers possible.

Information, is at the foundation of our every impulse. What would happen if we created a system of open technology built around **data first**. Not content, just, data. How 

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
